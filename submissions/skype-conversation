[21:51:11] Urs Liska: I won't be available for at least 45 min, and I didn't have the opportunity to do anything today :-(
[21:51:27] Jan Warchoł: bad luck
[21:51:35] Jan Warchoł: but i can wait 45 min
[21:51:46] Jan Warchoł: maybe i'll have some ideas till then
[22:37:53] Urs Liska: Hi.
[22:38:23] Urs Liska: Just downloaded Skype for my Debian computer and saw - "It's a Microsoft website". Did you know that?
[22:40:28] Urs Liska: I'm sure that wasn't there when I last downloaded it (don't know when that actually was. May have been years.
[22:44:59] Jan Warchoł: yeah, microsoft aquired skype some time ago
[22:45:17] Jan Warchoł: (sorry, i have to dry my hair - 5 more minutes)
[22:51:34] Verpasster Anruf von Jan Warchoł.
[22:51:41] Jan Warchoł: ok, i'm ready
[22:52:41] Urs Liska: Hmm, I see that you're calling. But I don't manage to accept the call ...
But I don't think it's the right time to check that out, sorry...
[22:53:10] Jan Warchoł: you mean that we should just write?
[22:53:35] Urs Liska: Seems to be the case. Kind of funny that we're struggling witht his kind of stuff .
[22:53:36] Jan Warchoł: maybe you should try calling me?
[22:53:52] Urs Liska: No, I think it's still with my hardware setup
[22:53:58] Jan Warchoł: (it's because of evil microsoft ;) )
[22:54:33] Urs Liska: Ah, of course! Probably I have to uninstall Chrome before it may work.
[22:54:43] Urs Liska: ;-) (Or probably rather Debian ...)
[22:55:16] Jan Warchoł: :)
[22:55:37] Urs Liska: To LAC: I suppose the pdf you got lately isn't up to date, but I don't know how far the differences have gone in between.
[22:56:17] Urs Liska: Maybe the "easy" one first: I think I won't submit the *other* paper for the LAC, for several reasons.
[22:56:44] Urs Liska: First is that there may be several aspects to the idea that would need further refinement and thinking.
[22:57:25] Urs Liska: Second I'm not sure if it's a good idea to make the ideas public now in such a way that doesn't keep in in any control over it.
[22:57:51] Jan Warchoł: you mean that someone could stole it?
[22:57:55] Jan Warchoł: *steal
[22:59:00] Urs Liska: Basically yes. I keep the full copyright for the text, but of course not for the ideas. And *if* someone finds the basic ideas interesting they wouldn't need my expertise to implement it. It probably wouldn't hurt having me in the team, but it's definitely not necessary.
[23:00:26] Urs Liska: A fried of Peter Bjuhr suggested that these ideas *could* be of interest for Pyramix (the DAW often used in classical recording studios) or even Steinberg - because of their big movie target group (which might share concepts in the workflow).
[23:01:04] Urs Liska: It was also this guy who had quite interesting additional ideas that I should reconsider.
[23:01:09] Jan Warchoł: that's great!
[23:01:16] Jan Warchoł: what were they?
[23:02:51] Urs Liska: First (sounds futuristic but he insists that technology has already gone quite far): Try to analyse audio and display takes not (only) as a waveform/volume graph but as a score. (I doubt this will work in the near future for complex music, but maybe I should try to find some examples).
[23:04:45] Urs Liska: Second (kind of a consequence): try to define some *expectations*, that is, expect some audio characteristics based on previous recordings (i.e. have the score and try to determine if the recording matches that). This could aslo be used to identify the music automatically in later tracks.
[23:05:28] Urs Liska: That is: If I play the same music again for a second take it will look quite similar (that's what we currently use for navigating such a waveform display). This could be used to tag follow-up takes automatically.
[23:06:19] Jan Warchoł: yeah, sounds like a good idea.
[23:07:12] Jan Warchoł: concerning music recognition:
[23:07:42] Urs Liska: Anyway, combined with my "security" considerations it may be a good idea to let the "opportunity" go by unused - however, it isn't unused. Having written the paper to that extent was a good thing - apart from the fact that it took time from other tasks.
[23:07:44] Jan Warchoł: it should be possible to recognize beats and match that to the score (that should be provided in Lilypond fromat)
[23:08:09] Jan Warchoł: (i.e. the score should be provided)
[23:08:16] Jan Warchoł: (by the user)
[23:08:18] Urs Liska: There has to be a balance: You can't require to enter a full score, that would be out of balance
[23:08:56] Jan Warchoł: well, yes.  but if you already *have* it..
[23:09:24] Urs Liska: Of course. But that's not a viable basis for an application, rather a corner case.
[23:09:34] Jan Warchoł: hmm. maybe.
[23:11:01] Urs Liska: What I thought of was determining analog positions. When I have marked something as "measure 11" it should be possible to detect this in any other take with quite some reliability. And this approach would radically increase the use of the "access through musical references" approach.
[23:11:25] Jan Warchoł: yes, that's right
[23:11:32] Urs Liska: OK. But as I seem not to need this on Tuesday we could rather skip that for now.
[23:12:26] Urs Liska: To "our" paper: I'm probably simply confused. We do have so much material and - as I think - so good arguments and concepts, I don't really understand why it is so complicated to write this silly paper :-(
[23:12:41] Jan Warchoł: yeah, i know
[23:12:55] Jan Warchoł: i had the same feeling when rewriting Challenges' instructions
[23:12:57] Jan Warchoł: however
[23:13:05] Jan Warchoł: i think i realized something
[23:13:35] Jan Warchoł: what we lack is an introduction to the *problems* we claim version control solves
[23:14:51] Urs Liska: You did. And you were under pressure too. I think my problem is that I a) have a tight deadline, b) another issue to solve (Webern) with a tight deadline and c) so little time recently. I'm hardly able to work for more than one or 1 1/2 hours at a time, except for late in the evening - when I'm too tired for concentrated work ...
[23:15:11] Jan Warchoł: :(
[23:15:12] Urs Liska: Ah, your comment makes sense (although it doesn't immediately trigger a solution)
[23:15:29] Jan Warchoł: i think that what we should have is:
[23:16:09] Jan Warchoł: after the introduction (which is quite good; it should provide a 'a background story' without concrete arguments)
[23:16:35] Jan Warchoł: there should be a not-overly-long section "what is wrong with music editing now"
[23:16:53] Jan Warchoł: which should enumerate all the little&big annoyances
[23:16:57] Jan Warchoł: (with examples)
[23:17:32] Jan Warchoł: (sometimes it will be necessary to convince the reader that something is an annoyance, since he may think there's no problem -
[23:17:43] Jan Warchoł: that's why examples will be very important here)
[23:18:07] Jan Warchoł: and then there should be "*why* this is wrong"
[23:18:27] Jan Warchoł: where we explain why the things that are wrong are wrong (obviously :P)
[23:18:42] Jan Warchoł: for example:
[23:19:15] Jan Warchoł: what is wrong: it's annoying that the editor cannot make a fix after engraving but has to ask the engraver
[23:19:36] Jan Warchoł: why it's wrong: because the editor shouldn't mess with engraver's work
[23:19:57] Jan Warchoł: why this is wrong: because there are no ways to reasonably merge and compare files
[23:20:37] Jan Warchoł: this should prepare the reader for the next section(s), which should describe our experiences
[23:20:59] Jan Warchoł: (i'm not yet sure where the "plain text fundametnals" should be)
[23:21:22] Urs Liska: This sounds all very convincing.
[23:21:32] Jan Warchoł: :)
[23:21:44] Urs Liska: Question is how we should manage to finish that until Tuesday 11.59
[23:22:25] Urs Liska: Particularly since you're working at daytime and I'll have to go to Basel tomorrow, with a presentation that I still have to finish tonight...
[23:22:56] Jan Warchoł: ...we'll need a lot of coffee tomorro.w
[23:22:58] Jan Warchoł: :P
[23:23:58] Urs Liska: Sounds interesting. Unfortunately my average caffeine level is already where a considerable raise wouldn't have the desired effect ;-)
[23:24:10] Jan Warchoł: you know, i think that what you've already written is good - doesn't need rewriting, just a bit restrcucturing
[23:24:20] Jan Warchoł: bad luck!
[23:25:07] Urs Liska: You still haven't a working LaTeX installation? Touching latex files on Github is quite convenient, but significant editing or writing isn't that practical (particular as you can't test for errors.
[23:26:07] Jan Warchoł: well, i haven't installed LaTeX at all (apart from what lily dependencies installed)
[23:26:55] Jan Warchoł: but my system is ok now, so i can try to install what is necessary
[23:27:05] Urs Liska: Ah, but then you could try to run lualatex on the paper. I _think_ lily dependencies are quite extensive ;-)
[23:28:06] Urs Liska: I'm asking because that might make sense, so we could work in parallel, maybe tomorrow evening. Assing sections or the like.
[23:29:14] Jan Warchoł: i should run 'lualatex liska-recording-classical-music.tex'?
[23:29:23] Urs Liska: I think we should stop soon. I will have to do something for the Webern presentation (OMG, I don't even know if that's an important meeting tomorrow or not ...). Then I could reread your comments from above one by one along the existing paper and see how far I'll get tonight more or less by restructuring existing stuff.
[23:29:56] Urs Liska: No. First checkout the 'plaintext' branch and then run lulatex advanced-workflows...
[23:30:07] Urs Liska: lualatex
[23:30:40] Jan Warchoł: lualatex advanced-workflows-for-scholarly-editions.tex says

[23:31:50] Urs Liska: OK. This means more latex packages. But you can try commenting out line 8 of the file. This includes my personal style file. Without this you should also be able to run pdflatex.
[23:33:09] Jan Warchoł: works!
[23:34:13] Urs Liska: OK, then we can work that way. This only adds some typographic sugar that I'd like to have in the submitted PDF. For their printed proceedings they would also take that package out.
[23:34:30] Jan Warchoł: ok
[23:35:04] Jan Warchoł: so, before i go to starting challenges' discussion on Phil submission
[23:35:13] Jan Warchoł: i may give you some more ideas
[23:35:18] Jan Warchoł: if you'd liek
[23:35:20] Jan Warchoł: *like
[23:35:40] Urs Liska: OK, I'd like :-)
[23:36:32] Jan Warchoł: example for the "sequential editing" in traditional approach: what i wrote at some moment before starting to use git - 'never beautify more than 1 song'
[23:36:54] Jan Warchoł: and then we have version control that gives us parallel processing of 26 songs
[23:37:30] Jan Warchoł: as for crowd engraving, you wrote:
[23:37:38] Jan Warchoł: You only need a few things to make this
a reliable process: a common understanding or
a set of rules of coding style (e. g. indentation,
amount of comments, of barchecks etc.) and
a usable communication infrastructure to keep
track of who is working on what.
[23:37:54] Jan Warchoł: i think that coding style is completely irrelevant for this paper
[23:37:59] Jan Warchoł: 2ndly,
[23:38:25] Jan Warchoł: i think you actually don't need to know who is doing what - that's the magic of version control
[23:38:53] Urs Liska: I wanted to say we should take care that two people don't do the same work
[23:38:59] Jan Warchoł: the only thing that is needed is to ensure that more than one man won't work on one fragment, but that's only because we doon't want to waste work
[23:39:03] Jan Warchoł: :))
[23:39:10] Jan Warchoł: exactly
[23:39:35] Jan Warchoł: but this is not because version control wouldn't manage it - it's because it would be a waste
[23:41:16] Jan Warchoł: ah, and another exampple
[23:41:45] Jan Warchoł: you can mention that situation when you accidentally reverted some of my beautifications, and i spotted it
[23:41:59] Jan Warchoł: that's a good example of how versioning and plain text helps
[23:42:07] Jan Warchoł: :)
[23:42:53] Jan Warchoł: hmm, i think that's all that comes to my mind now
[23:43:30] Jan Warchoł: you'll know best what editing chores to list :)
[23:45:09] Urs Liska: OK, thanks. Unfortunately I can't convincingly narrate about the Finale hell anymore ;-/
[23:45:18] Jan Warchoł: heh
[23:45:38] Jan Warchoł: you may point people to the Challenges :P
[23:46:12] Jan Warchoł: (i'm stunned by how hard Finale fails with Estrella - i didn't expect these horrible accent-rest collisions!)
[23:46:21] Jan Warchoł: oh!
[23:46:23] Jan Warchoł: i know!
[23:47:15] Urs Liska: Actually what I'm going to do tomorrow is fix one of the typography issues I entered for the Fried songs. I think this is a good demonstration: Issue - fix - commit - close issue via commit - push - see on bitbucket, see diff on bitbucket.
[23:47:46] Jan Warchoł: yeah - it might be a good idea to include a picture
[23:48:07] Urs Liska: We don't have too much space in the paper. 8 pages in total
[23:48:11] Jan Warchoł: (make sure to choose an extremely simple example for that, probably a wrong pitch)
[23:49:26] Urs Liska: The problem is that the one wrong pitch I noticed is already fixed. I will show that (for the topic of post-publication maintainability), so I need on of the other issues. Of course I will 'rehearse' the fix before ;-)
[23:49:43] Jan Warchoł: :)
[23:49:47] * Jan Warchoł hat die Datei finale undo problem.png gesendet.
[23:50:07] Jan Warchoł: this is an exampple of Finale hell :)
[23:50:35] Jan Warchoł: (not sure if it works like this in 2014 version, but it's a pretty recent one - 2011 i think)
[23:50:58] Urs Liska: But I don't think it's suitable for our paper. This is a case of bad software, but it isn't related to plain text or versioning.
[23:51:10] Jan Warchoł: but it is!
[23:51:25] Jan Warchoł: something happens inside a file without you knowing
[23:51:45] Jan Warchoł: and you cannot go back to the previous state except for the undo function
[23:51:59] Jan Warchoł: imagine this:
[23:52:05] Jan Warchoł: you had a good file
[23:52:31] Jan Warchoł: than you changed something like this, saved and exited (because it appeared to be the right thing to do)
[23:52:46] Jan Warchoł: but then you realize you don't want it - try to go back and boom!
[23:53:01] Jan Warchoł: you cannot use undo
[23:53:23] Jan Warchoł: you don't see *why* his is exploding and how exactly it goes wrong
[23:53:35] Urs Liska: I think Sibelius offers undo beyond saved states.
[23:54:12] Jan Warchoł: but then you wouldn't be able to cherry-pick and undo just one part of a modification, would you?
[23:54:30] Urs Liska: But otherwise your descriptions are convincing. Maybe it's difficult to write this concisely enough for our paper. These columns are very narrow ...
[23:54:36] Jan Warchoł: (i.e. if together with this uglyfying change you made a legitimate one)
[23:54:48] Urs Liska: No, of course Sibelius' undo is surely one-dimensional
[23:54:51] Jan Warchoł: you'll manage, i believe in you :)
[23:54:58] Jan Warchoł: :D:D
[23:55:35] Urs Liska: Nice goodnight words ;-) I think we should shut down now and stop talking about what we would do if we wouldn't talk right now about what we would do ...
[23:55:54] Jan Warchoł: ok
[23:56:05] Urs Liska: Good night, see you tomorrow ...
[23:56:14] Jan Warchoł: (but if you run out of inspiration, i can send you 2 more exampples :P)
[23:56:24] Jan Warchoł: did you make me admin of the forum?
[23:56:42] Urs Liska: Not yet, but I'll do that tonight.
[23:56:49] Jan Warchoł: good!
[23:56:56] Jan Warchoł: i'd like to sort this out now
[23:57:02] Urs Liska: And yes, I love these examples (but rather send it by email.)
[23:57:10] Urs Liska: OK, wait a minute.
[23:57:22] Jan Warchoł: (ok, will email next time)
Montag, 27. Januar 2014
[00:00:25] Urs Liska: now you should be "full admin"
[00:01:15] Jan Warchoł: great, thanks!
[00:02:07] Jan Warchoł: good night, and sleep well :)
[00:03:03] Urs Liska: Rather: Don't sleep too early ;-) Unfortunately my alarm will start at 6:30 (school, we should train them to do it alone, haha)
[00:03:08] Urs Liska: Good night!
