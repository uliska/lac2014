A discussion of the role plain text based tools can play in the preparation of
scholarly editions. This paper is based on the authors' experience with an
edition prepared with LilyPond and \LaTeX, as well as the prospects with
another edition currently in preparation.
Focus is on collaborative workflows powered by version control -- a concept that
is to our knowledge nearly non-existent in current scholarly work,

\section{Introduction}
Recently we published a revised edition of the songs of Oskar Fried (1871\,--\,1941)%
\footnote{\url{http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oskar\_Fried}}.
It was realized with a small team of only two musicologists (Urs Liska and Alexander
Gurdon) and one music engraver (Janek Warchoł).
It soon turned out that the project had a larger scale than expected, mainly for two
-- independent -- reasons: the revision dug up a lot more questions than we had thought of,
and he music's complexity was a real challenge for both the notation program and the 
engraver.

While it was clear right from the start that we'd use Lilypond%
\footnote{\url{http://www.lilypond.org}} as the notation program we only decided
halfway through the project to use \emph{versioning} to organize the plain text input
files LilyPond processes. This went along with the decision to use \LaTeX{} to compile
text and scores to a contigious volume.

As it turned out this was one of the most influential decisions we took in recent years
because preparing an edition with version control opens up completely new approaches to
collaborative work. While this style of working is obvious in software development it
applies \emph{equally} to scholarly editions and engraving scores.

\medskip
This paper is a rather personal report of our experiences with this project as well as
some comments on a project we're currently starting, and which is intended to become
a reference project for \emph{crowd engraving}, a more or less unknown concept that is
originally made possible by version control. We also wrote a number of blog posts on
\emph{Scores of Beauty}%
\footnote{\url{http://lilypondblog.org/category/fried-songs}}
which you may enjoy as additional reading.

\section{Fundamentals}
Editing plain text source files is a daunting task for people not used to it.
A majority of musicians, musicologists or music engravers are frightened when
confronted with a LilyPond input file, and often they have strong reservations
against the “nerdy” stuff. They want to \emph{see} what they're doing instead of entering
markup. However, plain text workflows offer substantial advantages over \textsc{wysiwyg}
approaches, and this is what we're going to talk about in this paper. Urs has written
an extensive essay on the subject%
\footnote{\url{http://lilypondblog.org/2013/07/plain-text-files-in-music/}}
so we can keep the general summaries quite short and concentrate on some specific stuff
about our collaborative experiences.

\subsection{Plain Text}
Tools processing plain text files are fundamentally different from graphical
\textsc{wysiwyg} programs, particularly regarding their file/document handling.
Plain text files have characteristics which we consider fundamentally superior to
binary (and maybe even proprietary) file formats. The key aspects are:

\paragraph{Transparency:}
Graphical programs using binary files don't give a clue on how they manage your input.
Looking at an item in a graphical score editor one can't tell if this is placed by the
automatic layout algorithms or tweaked manually. And \emph{if} it is tweaked manually,
there is no way to see how the program handles that tweak, to which reference point it
is bound etc.

In a plain text file every aspect of the document is revealed, each tweak is explicitly
present as written text. This doesn't only make a document file more transparent but also
allows the editor to cleanly revert any tweak if she should manage to break anything
through an inappropriate tweak.

\paragraph{Separation of concerns:}
A very important aspect of this transparency is the clean separation of content, meaning
and appearance in plain text files. Through the use of explicit commands the content
of a document is clearly marked up semantically, so that in an expression like
\texttt{\textbackslash editorial Dots \{c4. d\}} it is clear that the \emph{content} (dots)
in the music expression is given a \emph{meaning} (“editorial”), while this is completely
independent from its graphical representation.

\paragraph{Readability and Stability:}
Plain text files are human readable, binary files are not. This simple statement has
considerable implications on the handling of documents. When binary files get damaged
(for example through disk failure) they are usually unusable completely. In plain text files
on the other hand any single rescued character can be used to reconstruct the original
document, even if it is directly read from the disk surface. The same is true for the
aging and dying of programs and operating systems -- a natural process that plain text
file formats can survive much better than binary ones.

\paragraph{Editor independence:}
Plain text tools separate the tasks of editing, processing and displaying documents,
making it possible to choose different tools for different tasks. Plain text files
can principally be edited with \emph{any} text editor, which opens a wide array of
workflow options, for example editing on smartphones or through web interfaces.

An extreme example of an “editor” would be a programming language. Plain text files can
be edited or generated programmatically, opening up yet more options. This programmability
goes way beyond any scripting interfaces graphical tools may offer.

\paragraph{Compiling vs. Instant Feedback:}
~\\\textbf{TODO:} Should this be written or left out?

\section{Collaboration}
% Hands-on experiences from the Fried songs edition

\subsection{Interaction Between Editor and Engraver}
% It is actually a hot topic in scholarly discussion
% to what extent the editor should also be an engraver.
% Scholarly editions usually let the editor only provide
% a model, while an engraver from the publishe prepares the
% score. By contrast commercial publishers usually require
% the editor to prepare a near-printable score document.
